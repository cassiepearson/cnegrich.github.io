      <description>Description ConstrictPy is a python tool that implements the ConstrictR package. ConstrictPy handles all the input and output, provides a UI, and data visualization that ConstrictR lacks. ConstrictPy is designed to be extremely user friendly and requires minimal technical skills to use effectively. Currently in development, full release of ConstrictPy is planned for the near future. See below for the source code. Image downloaded from unsplash and taken by Sharon McCutcheon.</description>

      <description>Description ConstrictR is an R package inspired by a paper by Lionel Guidi designed for microbiome analysis. However, since it is just a package of useful bioinformatical analysis functions, it can be applied to a wide variety of data. The philosophy behind the project is to make an R package that is as user friendly as possible. We want a use of any experience level to have access to more complicated mathematical analysis techniques.</description>
