ConstrictPy handles all the input and output, provides a UI, and data visualization that ConstrictR lacks. ConstrictPy is designed to be extremely user friendly and requires minimal technical skills to use effectively. \
\
Currently in development, full release of ConstrictPy is planned for the near future. See below for the source code. \

However, since it is just a package of useful bioinformatical analysis functions, it can be applied to a wide variety of data. The philosophy behind the project is to make an R package that is as user friendly as possible. We want a use of any experience level to have access to more complicated mathematical analysis techniques.</description></item></channel></rss>
