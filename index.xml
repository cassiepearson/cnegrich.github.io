      <description>Why? Sending secure emails is important if any sensitive information needs to be sent. This could include a vulnerability disclosure, anything with personally identifiable information (PII), or any other information that you consider sensitive.
How? I will explain how to send a secure email to me specifically below. But many other people have written similar tutorials, here is a link to a Tech Republic article on it. We will be using gpg (Gnome Privacy Guard) for this tutorial.</description>

      <description> Description ConstrictPy is a python tool that implements the ConstrictR package. ConstrictPy handles all the input and output, provides a UI, and data visualization that ConstrictR lacks. ConstrictPy is designed to be extremely user friendly and requires minimal technical skills to use effectively. Currently in development, full release of ConstrictPy is planned for August 2018. See below for the source code and documentation page.

      <description>Description This is my personal website used to host a some small posts and personal coding projects.
I consistently update this site with new content, both posts and projects. Below, I have linked to the source code and hosting respositories on github and have linked to my post explaining how I created this site. Look closely into the github repository and you may even get a glimpse of future posts and projects.</description>

      <description>Description ConstrictR is an R package inspired by a paper by Lionel Guidi designed for microbiome analysis. However, since it is just a package of useful bioinformatical analysis functions, it can be applied to a wide variety of data. The philosophy behind the project is to make an R package that is as user friendly as possible. We want a use of any experience level to have access to more complicated mathematical analysis techniques.</description>

      <description>Background I am a recent college graduate from the Barrett Honors College at Arizona State University (ASU) with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics working at Deca Technologies who is very interested in data science and cybersecurity. During my time at ASU, I worked on several different research projects mostly focused on computer science and software development, but also including work in both wet labs and cybersecurity. Although my degree is in mathematics, I spent my time focusing on applying it to computer engineering and cryptography.</description>
