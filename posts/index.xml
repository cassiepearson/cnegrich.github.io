      <description>Why? Sending secure emails is important if any sensitive information needs to be sent. This could include a vulnerability disclosure, anything with personally identifiable information (PII), or any other information that you consider sensitive.
How? I will explain how to send a secure email to me specifically below. But many other people have written similar tutorials, here is a link to a Tech Republic article on it. We will be using gpg (Gnome Privacy Guard) for this tutorial.</description>

      <description>Background I am a recent college graduate from the Barrett Honors College at Arizona State University (ASU) with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics working at Deca Technologies who is very interested in data science and cybersecurity. During my time at ASU, I worked on several different research projects mostly focused on computer science and software development, but also including work in both wet labs and cybersecurity. Although my degree is in mathematics, I spent my time focusing on applying it to computer engineering and cryptography.</description>
