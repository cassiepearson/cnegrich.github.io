#### Description

ConstrictR is an R package inspired by a paper by Lionel Guidi designed for microbiome analysis. However, since it is just a package of useful bioinformatical analysis functions, it can be applied to a wide variety of data. The philosophy behind the project is to make an R package that is as user friendly as possible. We want a use of any experience level to have access to more complicated mathematical analysis techniques. \\
\\
ConstrictR is currently a work in progress with plans on the full version being available in near future. See below for the source code. \\
