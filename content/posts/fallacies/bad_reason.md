## Overview

---

The bad reason fallacy is a formal logical fallacy that comes from arguing a conclusion is bad because a reason for it is bad. This is a fallacy since the conclusion can be true despite being providing a false argument.

## Fallacy Names

---

- Bad reason fallacy

## Structure

---

Proposition A because of the argument B.
B is false, therefore the proposition A is false.

If A then B because C.
Not C, therefore if A, then not B.

## Examples

---

This drive is encrypted using two key files because it is using asymmetric encryption. But the system uses symmetric encryption, therefore it cannot have two key files.
- This is an example of a bad reason fallacy. It is possible for a symmetric key to be split into two files. This may facilitate two party verification. Therefore, the argument against it being symmetric does not invalidate that two key files can exist. The conclusion is not invalidated because the argument used to make it is false.

This drive is encrypted with a 128 bit key. Therefore it is using symmetric encryption. But the drive is actually encrypted with a 256 bit key, therefore symmetric encryption is not being used.
- This is false, AES is likely to have a 128 or a 256 bit key. This reason does not invalidate, but actually may provide support for the conclusion. 

Consider a programming team where all bugs are fixed when a severity level is reached. A team meets and fails to present any compelling argument for the severity of a bug. Therefore, the team concludes that the bug is low severity and does not need to be fixed.
- If the team was given insufficient time or resources to investigate or assess the bug, then compelling arguments may exist that were not uncovered.

## Avoidance

It is important to question arguments of any conclusions made. Though, if an argument is dismissed, the voracity of the conclusion or the argued proposition should be considered independently.
