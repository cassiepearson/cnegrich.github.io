## Overview

---

Affirming a disjunct is a logical fallacy that occurs in propositional logic when a disjunct is assumed. The logical operator or is inclusive, meaning it can be A or B or both. This fallacy occurs when a disjunct is assumed. That is the assumption of the terms A implies not B and B implies not A.

## Fallacy Names

---

- Affirming a disjunct

## Structure

---

Given A or B.  
A therefore not B.  

## Examples

---

The sun is shining or it is raining.
The sun is shining therefore it is not raining. Equivalently, it is raining therefore the sun is not shining.
- Both of the implications could be false. It could be cloudy and not raining. There could be a sunshower.

The packet is malicious or it is harmless.
The packet is not malicious therefore it is harmless.
- This is false. A packet sent without malicious intent could have unintended consequences and should still be verified.

## Avoidance

---

First, when considering potential binary choices, question if there are other options available. Second, when dealing with or statements always consider whether the implication is inclusive or exclusive. Finally, always check first order propositions for potential logical inconsistencies. This could be done with a truth table that is used to verify that the conclusion is not in violation of the proposition posed.
