These postulates are the minimum necessary set of assumptions required for Euclid&amp;rsquo;s proofs.
Postulates (Assumptions):
To draw a straight line from any point to any point A finite straight line is a line between any two points To produce a finite straight line continuous in a straight line A finite continuous straight line exists To Describe a circle with any center and distance A circle can exist with any radius That, if a straight lines falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side which are the angles less than the two right angles To restate that, two skewed lines will eventually intersect on the side where the angle is acute Notions - Axioms Notions are axioms for Euclid&amp;rsquo;s Elements.</description></item></channel></rss>
